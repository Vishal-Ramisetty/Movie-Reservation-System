Step 1: Create the Monolithic Application of Movie

Step 2: Migrate the Monolithic App by creating a HLD and LLD for Microservices.

Step 3: Convert the Monolithic Application into Microservices.

Step 4: Make sure each Microservice follows SOLID principles,DRY and implement design patterns where applicable.

Step 5: Follow best API Design Practices.

Step 5.1 : Use RESTful APIs with proper HTTP methods and status codes. (Use JAVA Version 17+)
Step 5.2 : Use DAO, DTO
Step 5.3 : Implement Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting for data retrieval.
Step 5.4 : Implement proper error handling and validation.
Step 5.5 : Define Database schema either with MYsql or MongoBD ( Inject Database scripts where applicable / use data.sql for seeding data)

Step 6: Integrate with Spring Security , Spring Cloud , WebFlux - For Reactive Programming.

Step 7: Create containers for each Microservice using Docker.

Step 8: Use Redis,Kafka for caching and messaging.

Step 9: Use Circuit Breaker pattern for fault tolerance and Rate Limiting.

Step 10: Document the APIs using Swagger/OpenAPI.

Step 11: Use API Gateway like Zuul or Spring Cloud Gateway.

Step 12: Implement Service Discovery using Eureka or Consul with micrservices communication using Feign Client or RestTemplate.

Step 13: Monitor the Microservices using Prometheus and Grafana.

Step 14: GitHub Documentation for the entire project.



(Optional)
Step 1: Set up CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins or GitHub Actions

Step 2: Deploy the Microservices on Cloud Platforms like AWS, Vercel or Harness

Step 3: Write Unit Tests and Integration Tests for each Microservice(Junit, Mockito, Spring Test).
